  "feedback": "This is an outstanding resume for a Backend Software Engineer Intern role, demonstrating a rare level of professional experience and technical depth for an intern. The candidate's background in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and specific technologies like Kubernetes and AWS is exceptionally strong and directly aligns with the job description.",
  "section_feedback": {
    "experience": "The experience section is the strongest part, showcasing 2.4 years of highly relevant professional work. Bullet points are packed with specific, quantifiable achievements directly related to distributed systems, microservices, AWS (Lambda, SQS, API Gateway), Python/Java, and API development. The metrics are compelling and demonstrate significant impact. While Kubernetes and Docker are listed in skills and projects, explicit professional experience using them in the work bullets would make this section absolutely perfect, but this is a minor point given the overall strength.",
    "skills": "The skills section is comprehensive and perfectly aligned with the job description. All required technologies (Python, Java, AWS Lambda/SQS/EC2, Kubernetes, Docker, REST APIs, Microservices, Distributed Systems) are explicitly listed. The categorization is logical and highlights key areas effectively, with no critical missing skills.",
    "projects": "Projects are highly relevant and demonstrate significant technical depth. The 'Orion Platform' project is particularly impressive, showcasing hands-on experience with Go, Kubernetes Operators, Docker, and event-driven distributed systems, directly addressing core JD requirements. The other projects reinforce strong backend, API, and database skills, effectively complementing the professional experience.",
    "presentation": "The resume is exceptionally well-presented. The header and summary are concise, compelling, and immediately highlight the candidate's key strengths and alignment with the role. Bold markers are used strategically and effectively to emphasize critical keywords and metrics, and the writing quality is professional, clear, and action-oriented throughout."
