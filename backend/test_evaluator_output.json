  "feedback": "This is an exceptionally strong resume for a Backend Software Engineer Intern role, demonstrating significant professional experience and deep technical expertise directly aligned with the job description. The candidate's background in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and specific technologies like AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker is outstanding. This candidate is likely overqualified for an intern role, which is a positive signal.",
  "section_feedback": {
    "experience": "Exceptional relevance, directly addressing distributed systems, microservices, AWS, Python/Java, and API development. The professional experience (2.4 years at LSEG, 1.9 years at Infosys) is far beyond typical intern expectations, showcasing a strong track record. Metrics are compelling, specific, and quantify impact effectively, demonstrating scalability and performance improvements. No significant areas for improvement; the experience section is a major strength.",
    "skills": "Comprehensive and perfectly aligned with the job description. All key technologies (Python, Java, AWS Lambda/SQS/EC2, Kubernetes, Docker, REST APIs, Microservices, Distributed Systems) are explicitly listed. The categorization is logical and easy to read, highlighting a broad and deep technical foundation. No critical missing skills or areas for improvement. The breadth of skills is impressive.",
    "projects": "The 'Orion Platform' project is outstanding, directly showcasing advanced Kubernetes, Docker, Go, and event-driven system development, which is highly relevant to distributed systems and cloud infrastructure. The 'Kambaz LMS' project effectively demonstrates RESTful API backend development. Project bullets show good technical depth and specific implementations. While strong, the 'Port Management System' is slightly less focused on distributed systems or cloud-native aspects compared to the other projects, though it still highlights solid Python backend and database skills. This is a minor point given the strength of the other projects.",
    "presentation": "The summary is highly effective, concise, and immediately highlights key qualifications and alignment with the role. Bold markers are used strategically and effectively throughout the entire resume to draw attention to critical keywords, technologies, and quantifiable achievements, significantly enhancing readability and impact. The overall writing quality is professional and polished. No areas for improvement; the presentation is excellent."
